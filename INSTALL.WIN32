Windows Installation
====================

Extract the SCEW distribution library to it's installation location. For
example, the scew-0.3.2 distribution may be extracted to the directory

  c:\lib\scew-0.3.2

Open the scew.dsp file from win32 directory in Visual Studio 6 or Visual
Studio  .NET  2002/2003.  Go  to  the  'Build'  menu and  select  'Batch
Build...'.   Select all  of the  configurations  to be  built and  click
'Rebuild  All'.   This will  build  versions  of  the SCEW  library  for
Debug/Release, MBCS/Unicode and not/XML_STATIC.

Note that  SCEW is always  linked statically with your  application. The
XML_STATIC compile option determines whether  libexpat will be used as a
static linked library or a DLL.

Add the  following directories to  the DevStudio Project paths.  This is
available via the 'Tools', 'Options' menu. 'Directories' in DevStudio 6,
'Projects' in DevStudio .NET.

  Include Directories
    SCEW top level, e.g. "c:\lib\scew-0.3.2"

  Library Directories
    SCEW win32 lib, e.g. "c:\lib\scew-0.3.2\win32\lib"

You will also  have to include your Expat  library directory to Includes
and Library:

  Include and Library Directories
    <expat_install>\source\lib e.g. "c:\lib\expat\source\lib"

To use SCEW in your application, you simply include the SCEW header file
like:

  #include <scew/scew.h>

Including this header will  automatically cause the correct SCEW library
to  be  linked  in  with   your  application  for  the  current  compile
settings.  You  do not  need  to  add the  SCEW  library  to the  linker
settings.

Note: you  do need to add  the appropriate Expat library  to your linker
settings.
