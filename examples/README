  This directory contains, as its  name suggests, examples on how to use
the SCEW library. Here is the list of the examples that you will find:


        - scew_print/           Prints any XML file.


  In order to compile the examples, you must add the next linking flags:
-lexpat  and  -lscew. That  is,  for  'scew_print',  you should  do  the
following:

        gcc -c scew_print.c -I/usr/local/include
        gcc -o scew_print scew_print.o -L/usr/local/lib -lexpat -lscew

  In the compilation example above,  I have supposed that SCEW and Expat
are installed in the /usr/local directory.
