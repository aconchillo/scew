Welcome to SCEW (Simple C Expat Wrapper)
========================================

   The aim of SCEW is to provide an easy interface around the XML
Expat parser, as well as a simple interface for creating new XML
documents. It provides functions to load and access XML elements
without the need to create Expat event handling routines every time
you want to load a new XML document.

These are the main SCEW features:

    - New XML documents can be created from scratch.
    - Loads XML documents into memory and allows working with them.
    - Writes XML documents to multiple outputs.
    - Can copy and compare full XML documents, elements or attributes.
    - Allows adding new I/O sources easily.
    - Supports loading concatenated XML documents.
    - UTF-8, ISO-8859-1 and US-ASCII encodings (and UTF-16 in Windows).
