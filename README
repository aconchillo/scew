Welcome to SCEW (Simple C Expat Wrapper)
========================================

    The aim of SCEW is to provide an easy interface around the XML
Expat parser. It provides functions to load and access XML elements
without the need to create the Expat event handling routines every
time you want to load an XML document. SCEW also incorporates
functions to create and manage XML documents.

    SCEW has the following features:

    - Loads XML documents from files or memory.
    - Handles elements and attributes.
    - Has copy and comparisson functions for XML documents.
    - Outputs XML documents to files or memory.
    - Loads and handles processing instructions.

    What does it not support?

    - Only supports Expat character encodings.
    - XML comments.
    - CDATA sections.
