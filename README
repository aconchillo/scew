Welcome to SCEW (Simple C Expat Wrapper)

  The  aim of SCEW  is to  provide an  easy interface  to the  XML Expat
library.  Expat gives an API  based on event handling mechanisms to load
the  XML  tree structure.  Eventhough,  since  version  0.2.0, SCEW  has
incorporated functions to create and save XML trees.

  SCEW provides  functions to load  and access XML elements  without the
need  to  create the  event  handling  routines  and probably  the  most
important: without  the need  to rewrite these  functions each  time you
need  to load a  different XML  tree.  It  also lets  you access  to the
internal  Expat  parser,   that  means  you  can  still   have  all  the
functionality that Expat library gives you.
