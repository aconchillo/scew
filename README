Welcome to SCEW (Simple C Expat Wrapper)
========================================

    The aim of SCEW is to provide an easy interface around the XML
Expat parser. It provides functions to load and access XML elements
without the need to create Expat event handling routines every time
you want to load a new XML document. It also lets you access to the
internal Expat parser, that means you still have all the functionality
that Expat gives you.

    These are the main SCEW features:

    - Loads XML documents into memory and allows working with them.
    - Writes XML documents to multiple outputs.
    - New XML documents can be created from scratch (no load needed).
    - Can copy and compare full XML documents, elements or attributes.
    - Allows the creation of new input and output interfaces.

    What does it not support?

    - Only supports Expat character encodings (i.e. UTF-8 and UTF-16).
    - XML comments (a user handler can be provided).
    - CDATA sections (a user handler can be provided).
