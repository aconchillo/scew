------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Version 1.0.0 (2008/??/??)

** API changes:

   - Added copy  and comparisson functions in most  SCEW types: trees,
     elements and attributes.

   - A new type, scew_list, has been defined and used for scew_element
     children and attributes. scew_list provides a general way to work
     with  lists, thus  no  code repetition  is  done and  there is  a
     flexible and general way to work with lists.

   - Added  scew_element_detach, which  detaches an  element  from its
     parent (it does not free it).
     (suggested by Alex Katebi)

   - Added scew_element_parent,  which returns an  element's parent if
     any.
     (thanks to dsk AT purdue DOT edu / Alex Katebi)

   - Added scew_element_add_pair  which allows to add  a new attribute
     with a name and contents.
     (thanks to Christopher Layne)

** Changes:

   - C99 standard adopted.

   - Test cases have been added using Check unit testing framework.
     (see http://check.sf.net)

   - Code has been  cleaned to allow better definition  of private and
     public interfaces.

   - Documentation has been improved and organized into modules.

   - SCEW now uses libtool to generate a static or dynamic library.

   - Thread support can now be disabled (see ./configure --help).

** Fixes:

   - Fix compilation warnings in error.c and parser.c.
     (reported by Aaron S. Kurland)

   - Fix scew_tree_free documentation.
     (reported by Gord Shier)

   - Hardcoded gcc "CFLAGS" removed.
     (reported by Mark Zieg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Version 0.4.0 (2004/05/25)

** Changes:

   - Ability  to  load  and  XML  document from  an  stream  has  been
     added.  The stream may  not be  completed, so  it will  just load
     correct XML pieces.  A callback,  set by the user, will be called
     each time an element is available.
     (thanks to Gord Shier)

** Fixes:

   - Fixed   indentation  level   when   document  contains   multiple
     consecutive empty elements.
     (thanks to Tom Probasco)

   - scew_element_add_attr_pair()   did  not   add  a   new  attribute
     correctly if the attribute already existed.
     (reported by Matthew Peltzer)

   - Compiltaion  fixes  in  MSVC.   Compiler interpreted  a  function
     argument called list as the std::list.
     (reported by Renaud Dumont)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Version 0.3.2 (2004/01/30)

** Changes:

   - A new "Unknown error code" message has been added.
     (thanks to Brodie Thiesfield)

   - Improved support for Windows and Unix compilation.
     (thanks to Brodie Thiesfield)

   - Added improvements in str functions. mem.* has been removed.
     (thanks to Brodie Thiesfield)

   - Write functions have been moved from tree to new writer.* files.

   - Added a preamble section to the XML declaration.

** Fixes:

   - Allow building in a separate directory.
     (thanks to Kalle Valo)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Version 0.3.1 (2003/07/21)

** Changes:

   - Added missing performace improvements by using the linked list in
     element and attribute iterations.
     (thanks to Brodie Thiesfield)

   - Added exponentially  growing buffer  to avoid many  realloc calls
     which are slow and fragment memory in scew_element_list.
     (thanks to Brodie Thiesfield)

   - Performance  improvements  in  file  loading by  using  a  static
     buffer.
     (thanks to Brodie Thiesfield)

   - Added scew_parser_load_file_fp().
     (thanks to Brodie Thiesfield)

   - Some other minor changes.
     (thanks to Brodie Thiesfield)

** Fixes:

   - scew_isxdigit() was calling isdigit() instead of isxdigit().

   - scew_isxxxx() fixed.
     (thanks to Brodie Thiesfield)

   - strdup() is a GNU extension, replaced it by own version.

   - Fixed scew_element_by_name.
     (reported by Eric Fronheiser)

   - Warning fixes (level 4) in Microsoft Visual C++ 7.
     (thanks to Brodie Thiesfield)

   - Multi-thread   support    fixed   in   Microsoft    Visual   C++.
     __declspec(thread) did not work, use TLS functions instead.
     (thanks to Brodie Thiesfield)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Version 0.3.0 (2003/07/10)

** Changes:

   - Added more string functions.  New memory functions have also been
     added.

   - Performance improved in element and attribute iteration.
     (thanks to Sanzo Miyazawa)

   - Support for  XML declaration attributes has  been added (version,
     encoding, standalone).  This attributes can be changed using SCEW
     tree functions.

   - Improved white spaces treatment in XML element contents.

   - Added error system. See documentation for more details.

   - Added pkg-config file.
     (thanks to Neil Harvey)

   - Added 'make  doc'. If you  have doxygen installed (which  will be
     automatically  detected),  it  will  create  SCEW  documentation.
     Execute './configure --help' to see more documentation options.

   - 'make install' does not install example binaries anymore.

** Fixes:

   - scew_tree_save_file() did not fclose output file.
     (reported by Paul Bohme)

   - scew_element_free() did not decrement parent number of children.
     (reported by anonymous)
